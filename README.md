# HackSense

## Overview

**HackSense** is an exciting and innovative project currently under development. Our goal is to create a versatile and hackable sensor platform that integrates a variety of communication protocols and sensor types. 

## Project Status

This project is in the early stages of development. We are working on designing a flexible and modular sensor system that can be easily adapted and extended. The final version will include a diverse array of sensors and communication protocols, providing a broad range of applications and capabilities.

## Features

- **Hackable Design:** The sensor system is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for easy modification and extension.
- **Variety of Sensors:** We plan to incorporate multiple types of sensors to meet different needs and use cases.
- **Multiple Communication Protocols:** Support for various communication methods will be integrated to ensure compatibility with different systems.

## Future Updates

As development progresses, we will continue to update and refine the system. This will include:
- Adding new sensor types
- Enhancing communication protocol support
- Improving overall system performance and usability
